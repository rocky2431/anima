```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_API_BASEURL=your_openai_api_baseurl

BOT_USERNAME=your_bot_username
BOT_HOSTNAME=localhost
BOT_PORT=25565
BOT_AUTH='microsoft' # comment if you use offline mode
BOT_VERSION=1.20
```

1. Start the bot:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 🎮 Usage

Once the bot is connected, you can interact with it using chat commands in Minecraft. All commands start with `#`.

### Basic Commands

- `#help` - Show available commands
- `#follow` - Make the bot follow you
- `#stop` - Stop the current action
- `#come` - Make the bot come to your location

### Natural Language Commands

You can also give the bot natural language commands, and it will try to understand and execute them. For example:

- "Build a house"
- "Find some diamonds"
- "Help me fight these zombies"
- "Collect wood from nearby trees"
